"""
This file contains the smoothing utility functions. We have a number of
possible smoothers to choose from: windowed average, local weighted regression,
and a causal Savitzky-Golay filter.

Code is courtesy of Dmitry Shemetov, Maria Jahja, and Addison Hu.

These smoothers are all functions that take a 1D numpy array and return a smoothed
1D numpy array of the same length (with a few np.nans in the beginning). See the
docstrings for details.

class Smoother:
    """
    This is the smoothing utility class. It handles imputation and smoothing.
    Reasonable defaults are given for all the parameters, but fine-grained
    control is exposed.

    Instantiating a smoother class specifies a smoother with a host of parameters,
    which can then be applied to an np.ndarray with the function smooth:
    > smoother = Smoother(smoother_name='savgol', window_length=28, gaussian_bandwidth=144)
    > smoothed_signal = smoother.smooth(signal)

    Parameters
    ----------
    smoother_name: {'savgol', 'left_gauss_linear', 'moving_average', 'identity'}
        This variable specifies the smoother. We have four smoothers, currently:
        * 'savgol' or a Savtizky-Golay smoother (default)
        * 'left_gauss_linear' or a Gaussian-weight linear regression smoother
        * 'moving_average' or a moving window average smoother
        * 'identity' or the trivial smoother (no smoothing)
        Descriptions of the smoothers are available in the doc strings. Full details are
        in: https://github.com/cmu-delphi/covidcast-modeling/indicators_smoother.
    window_length: int
        The length of the averaging window for 'savgol' and 'moving_average'.
        This value is in the units of the data, which tends to be days.
    gaussian_bandwidth: float or None
        If float, all regression is done with Gaussian weights whose variance is
        half the gaussian_bandwidth. If None, performs unweighted regression. (Applies
        to 'left_gauss_linear' and 'savgol'.)
        Here are some reference values:
        time window    |     bandwidth
        7                        36
        14                       144
        21                       325
        28                       579
        35                       905
        42                       1303
    impute: {'savgol', 'zeros', None}
        If 'savgol' (default), will fill nan values with a savgol fit on the largest available time 
        window prior (up to window_length). If 'zeros', will fill nan values with zeros. 
        If None, leaves the nans in place.
    minval: float or None
        The smallest value to allow in a signal. If None, there is no smallest value.
        Currently only implemented for 'left_gauss_linear'.
    poly_fit_degree: int
        A parameter for the 'savgol' smoother which sets the degree of the polynomial fit.

    Methods
    ----------
    smooth: np.ndarray
        Takes a 1D signal and returns a smoothed version. Both arrays have the same length.
